# Changelog

## üåå 0.2.0

This release focuses on filling out all commands and improving stderr/out
handling for improved user experience!

### ‚ú® Features

- **`pack` and `publish` - [jamiebuilds], [pull/67]**
  You can now run `wasm-pack pack` to generate a tarball of your generated package,
  as well as run `wasm-pack publish` to publish your package to the npm registry.
  Both commands require that you have npm installed, and the `publish` command requires
  that you be logged in to the npm client. We're working on wrapping the `npm login`
  command so that you can also login directly from `wasm-pack`, see [pull/100] for more
  details.

- **`package.json` is pretty printed now - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/70]**

  Previously, `package.json` was not very human readable. Now it is pretty printed!

- **`collaborators` - [yoshuawuyts], [pull/70]**

  `wasm-pack` now will fill out the `collaborators` field in your `package.json` for
  you based on your `Cargo.toml` `authors` data. For more discussion on how we decided
  on this v.s. other types of `author` fields in `package.json`, see [issues/2].
